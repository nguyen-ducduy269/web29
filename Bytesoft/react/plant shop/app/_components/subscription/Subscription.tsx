              When I learned that monthly plant subscriptions exist, I
              immediately subscribed to houseplantbox. I read the reviews and
              wasn’t really sure what to expect, but my first plant arrived
              today (just 5 days after placing my order) and I’m thrilled. My
              baby’s tears plant shipped quickly, was well packaged and had zero
              damage. The plant was well watered and is full and healthy. I’m
              super pleased so far and I’m looking forward to many more months
              of plants.

              We gifted this subscription to my Mother in law as a Mother's Day
              Gift. She has always been a plant lover, but she said this was the
              coolest gift she has ever gotten. She loved the surprise element
              as well as the uniqueness of the plants themselves. We did have a
              small issue when the subscription auto-renewed (even though we had
              selected for it not to renew after the 3 months), but the seller
              was amazing to refund the 2nd subscription when we reached out to
              them. Was very pleased with this purchase and interaction!

              I love plants and really want to start a collection this year. My
              biggest issue is that I own 7 dogs and a cat. Well this box is
              perfect because they offer pet friendly boxes! My first plant did
              take a while to ship but that it is because unlike other boxes
              they only ship a certain time of the month. I was fine with
              waiting. The plant arrived well packages and safe and looks great.
              I think the price is super fair and about on par with what I would
              pay at my cheap local nursery that I often buy from too. I would
              recommend this to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a new
              plant and doesn’t need it right now. I’ll probably sign up for
              another option and gift a few boxes for upcoming birthdays because
              it’s an awesome gift.
