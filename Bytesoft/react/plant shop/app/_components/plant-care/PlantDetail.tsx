                  Air plants are easy to grow, but they must be given the
                  appropriate care in order to thrive. Proper watering and
                  lighting are the most important components of plant care, but
                  humidity and temperature also play a role.

                  <p>
                    Light is an important variable when it comes to keeping your
                    Air Plant healthy. We recommend placing your Air Plant near
                    a window with direct sunlight. Make sure the plant doesn't
                    get too much direct sun though! Too much sun will be harmful
                    to the Air Plant. Artificial light is also a great source of
                    light for Air Plants. Some types of air plants have a
                    blooming once in their life and will live for many years
                    with the appropriate care. Look for a reddish tint when the
                    air plant starts blooming.

                  <p>
                    Most Air Plants will be their healthiest with a weekly
                    watering. Air Plants will become dry while in the terrarium
                    and will need to be sprayed with water 1-3 times a week.
                    More often in a hot, dry environment, less often in a cool,
                    humid one. If you see the plants drying out, submerge the
                    Air Plant in a bowl of water upside down up to an hour.
                    Repeat weekly. They benefit from overnight soaks in water.
                    Please make sure to dry the plant completely after the
                    watering as the air plants can die from having water sitting
                    in the center of the plant or at the base.

                    Air is an important component of the health of an Air Plant.
                    All Air Plants live off the air and will be healthier in a
                    terrarium that is not enclosed. Place your Air Plant at a
                    distance from your heater or cooler to avoid drying out the
                    plant. After watering, Air Plants should be given enough
                    light and air circulation to dry in four hours or less. Do
                    not keep the plant constantly wet or moist.

                <h1>Common Problems Q&A</h1>
                <p>Why is the base of my air plant brown and mushy?</p>

                <p>
                  This may be a sign of root rot. A few ways to prevent this is
                  to stick to a consistent watering schedule to make sure you do
                  not overwater. A key thing to remember in that Air Plants
                  unlike most plants take in water through their leaves, not
                  their roots and they are vulnerable to overwatering.
                </p>

                <p>What are my leaves curling and browning?</p>

                <p>
                  This is likely a sign of under watering. Although Air Plants
                  are easy to take care of they still need water. Air Plants
                  should be watered about once a week.
                </p>

                <p>How often should I use my fertilizer spray?</p>

                <p>
                  Over fertilization can cause your Air Plant to burn. It is
                  recommended to only spray your air plant with fertilizer spray
                  once a month at the same time you water. A little goes a long
                  way!
