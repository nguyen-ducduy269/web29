I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

Water to keep soil moist at all times. Ficus elastica is a source of latex that is toxic to the skin, and poisonous if taken internally, so pet-owners and those allergic to latex should be cautious.",

At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

The upper leaf surface is green to purple with two wide, silvery-white stripes, while the lower leaf surface is a uniform deep magenta. If you look closely you can see the fine hairs along the leaf margins and may note that the surfaces seem to sparkle in bright light. Color intensity is greatest in full sun in our area but in more southern locations too much sun will cause the colors to wash out.",

I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

      "meet_content": "One of the most stunning and eye-catching plants you can cultivate inside is the begonia. They are not extremely fragile, but they may be a little demanding about light and water, which makes them a perfect intermediate-level plant project. With their complex leaves, begonias are vivacious and entertaining plants that will liven up your environment and offer a dash of color. ",

      "water": "The biggest issue in cultivating Begonias is finding the proper watering balance. Since Begonias are extremely sensitive to overwatering and are prone to developing root rot, the soil should ideally always be slightly moist but not soggy. Before watering, test the soil with your finger; the top inch should feel dry (approximately up to your first knuckle). While watering the soil, keep the leaves dry.",
      "humidity": "High",

        "Are Begonias easy to care for?",
        "Yes, as long as you give begonias the proper care, they are simple to cultivate. They are the pickiest when it comes to water and humidity, which can be challenging for some people to get just right.",
        "Do Begonias prefer sun or shade?",
        "The majority of Begonias prefer shade and will burn in direct sunlight. However this can vary slightly between different Begonia types.",
        "Can Begonias live indoors?",
        "Begonias are wonderful indoor plants and can survive indoors. Only the tuberous varieties, which need a period of winter hibernation, cannot be grown year-round inside."

Plants arise in spring from winter-dormant root tubers and flower in the full-color array, of the Non-Stop Series, from white through yellow and orange to red. These extravagant flowers are produced from summer to mid-autumn and are set among open, succulent stems across the plant. They are produced in a cluster of three buds, with two smaller female flowers next to the larger, usually double, and showier male flower. Leaves are fleshy, jagged and pointed, glossy and dark or medium green in color, many with flashes of red or bronze.",

        "What is the best size pot for my bromeliad?",
        "A bromeliad's roots act as anchor and do not grow very large. A small pot about 4-6 inches should be large enough to hold our bromeliad plants. Using a pot that is too large will result in the potting soil retaining too much water and can eventually lead to root rot which causes the plant to die.",
