Contacted company but they referred it to route provider, but we have never had USPS honor any damage claim and this box was in perfect shape and tracked 'on schedule' so not going there.

At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root.
