      "description": "There must‚Äôve been some issue with shipping, the plant arrived much later than the other item I ordered it with. The plant had also come out of the 6‚Äù pot and was loose in the packaging when I opened the box. She is very droopy and there is some slight browning to her leaves but hopefully after repotting her and getting some water it will be alright. She is still a gorgeous plant, I love all the colors, and can‚Äôt wait to watch her grow.",

Bought a tricolor queen for sister earlier and it was so beautiful that I hoped for similar.  Contacted company but they referred it to route provider, but we have never had USPS honor any damage claim and this box was in perfect shape and tracked 'on schedule' so not going there.  A partial refund by the company would have been a welcome gesture as both plants in this order will likely grow into beautiful plants in time so full replacement would be too much.  Just no instant gratification.  Sigh. Strange if this gets posted since I tried a numberof times to post the review with my genuine rating of 3 stars ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê.",

I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",
