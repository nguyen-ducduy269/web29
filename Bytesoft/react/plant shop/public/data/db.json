I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

The indoor vines of this plant love to change color according to how much light they receive. Turning pink is this houseplant’s way of showing you how well you are caring for it. The brighter the indirect light, the more pink variegation these plants may produce. Just remember to keep them away from direct sunlight.",

At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

Big, heart-shaped leaves are dark-green and splashed with silvery gray, giving them a satin sheen. Its compact growth habit makes Scindapsus pictus 'Argyraeus' a beautiful hanging basket plant. You'll see the best leaf color and variegation by keeping it in bright, indirect light. You'll also keep the plant healthy by boosting the humidity around it. In fact, its variegated foliage makes Satin Pothos a beautiful addition to a terrarium.",

I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",

        "Can Begonias live indoors?",

These extravagant flowers are produced from summer to mid-autumn and are set among open, succulent stems across the plant. They are produced in a cluster of three buds, with two smaller female flowers next to the larger, usually double, and showier male flower. Leaves are fleshy, jagged and pointed, glossy and dark or medium green in color, many with flashes of red or bronze.",

Using a pot that is too large will result in the potting soil retaining too much water and can eventually lead to root rot which causes the plant to die.",

      "light": "A Calathea Plant likes bright indirect light; so placing it in front of an east, west, or north window is ideal. Too much direct sun burns the leaves of a Calathea Plant and causes the beautiful leaf colors to fade.",

      "water": "Allow the top 2-3” to dry out before watering. Never let a Calathea Plant sit in water. Calathea Plants are very sensitive to the water you use. Hard water, soft water, fluoridated water, or water of poor quality causes the leaves of a Calathea Plant to turn brown from leaf burn. The best way to water a Calathea Plant is to use distilled water, rainwater, or allow your tap water to sit out overnight before using it. Keep the soil of a Calathea Plant moist but never soggy.",

        "Why are my leaves yellow?",
        "This may be a sign your plant is receiving too little water. You don't want the soil to be soggy but you do want to keep it moist. Calathea plants can survive short periods of under watering, but if it goes on for too long you will notice yellowing leaves.",
        "Why is the pattern on my leaves fading?",
        "When a Calathea receives full sunlight the Chlorophyll in the leaves takes over and the light and dark patterns fade or disappear. Simply move your plant to an area with more shade or indirect light, the amount of Chlorophyll will be reduced and the pattern will reappear.",
        "Why are my leaves turning brown and drying out?",
        "This is usually a sign the air in the room is too dry. You can move you plant to a room with more humidity, like the bathroom, laundry room or kitchen. If you want to leave the plant where it is, misting the leaves can help!"
