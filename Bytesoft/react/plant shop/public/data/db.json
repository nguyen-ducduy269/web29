I received 4 single leaf cuttings and 1 two leaf cutting, all of them had dark coloring on the stem part, but the leaves were pretty intact. At this moment, the two leaf cutting died and rotted, and the other 4 are alive. One of the 4 has two roots growing and the rest just have little leaf spikes developing. They all had the dark rot so I cut as much of it off as possible and thats when they started growing. They're in water to root. Overall, they look fine and seem to be healthy enough, but I'm a little confused with the dark color (rot i think) and sad about the dead cutting because it was the prettiest of the bunch.",
