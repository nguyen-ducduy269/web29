          At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be
          applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document
          (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
          structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header?
          Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such
          as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first
          two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to
          know to understand HTML.

          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for
          describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout,
          and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS is
          designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML
          and can be used with any XML-based markup language. CSS is popularly
          called the design language of the web.

          JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
          implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
          more than just sit there and display static information for you to
          look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
          animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet
          that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third of the web trio.
